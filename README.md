# Fuzz-on-RUST-compiler
Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that feeds programs with large amounts of unexpected or random inputs to uncover bugs, crashes, and security vulnerabilities. Mutation is the critical part for a wide range of coverage on fuzzing. Rust is a powerful compiler, we will implement fuzzing on it.
